        "## Conceptual Understanding\n",
        "AI-powered satellite analysis represents a fundamental shift from traditional remote sensing approaches. Unlike conventional methods that analyse individual satellite images in isolation, systems like AlphaEarth Foundations create unified digital representations by integrating multiple data sources into a number of embeddings. These embeddings aim to capture complex spatial and temporal patterns, with multiple applications of urban environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What are AlphaEarth Embeddings?\n",
        "AlphaEarth Foundations [@brown2025alphaearthfoundationsembeddingfield] is an artificial intelligence model developed by Google DeepMind that functions as a comprehensive Earth observation system. Rather than requiring users to process raw satellite imagery, the model provides pre-computed embeddings[^1] that distil complex environmental information into 64 numerical values for every 10×10 meter pixel across Earth's terrestrial and coastal zones.\n",
        "\n",
        "[^1]: Satellite embeddings are AI-generated feature representations of satellite imagery. Think of them as numerical \"fingerprints\" that capture the visual characteristics of a location - things like vegetation patterns, building density, water presence, and land use. Google provides pre-computed embeddings for the entire Earth, saving you from processing raw satellite images yourself.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Setup\n",
        "\n",
        "There are a number of prerequisites and libraries required for this tutorial.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **earthengine-api** is the official client library for Google Earth Engine. It allows you to access, process, and analyse geographic datasets hosted on Earth Engine directly from Python code.\n",
        "* **pandas** is used for data manipulation and analysis and provides data structures like DataFrame.\n",
        "* **geopandas** makes working with geographic data in pandas easier. It extends pandas DataFrames to support geometry columns (points, lines, polygons), enabling spatial operations, reading/writing GIS file formats, and easy mapping. \n",
        "* **pyarrow** provides columnar in-memory data platform that enables fast reading and writing of various data formats (especially Parquet files) between different systems, and accelerates analytic operations of large datasets.\n",
        "* **scikit-learn** is a machine learning library for data mining and analysis.\n",
        "* **clustergram** helps visualise the most effective partitioning of data using clusters analysis (k means).\n",
        "* **umap-learn** - is dimensionality reduction technique that creates visualisations of high-dimensional data.\n",
        "* **seaborn** - a data visualisation library.\n",
        "* **plotly** - an interactive plotting library.\n",
        "* **matplotlib** - a fundamental plotting library.\n",
        "* **numpy** - used for numerical operations and mathematical calculations.\n",
        "* **requests** - downloading images from Google Earth Engine URLs and other web requests.\n",
        "* **PIL (Python Imaging Library)** - used for image processing and display.\n",

Because the raw dataset shows unique identifiers for a wide range of landscape and built environment features, these were limited to only those where the TOID had an associated [UPRN](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/products/os-open-uprn), which are an authoritative identifier used to uniquely identify addressable locations.\n",

In our case, UMAP takes the 64-dimensional embedding vectors and projects them onto a 2D plot while preserving the relationships between data points—locations that are similar in the original 64-dimensional space will appear close together in the 2D visualisation.\n",

Well-separated clusters in the UMAP plot indicate that the clustering algorithm has identified genuinely distinct building types, while overlapping clusters suggest that some building types may be too similar to distinguish reliably using the satellite embeddings.\n",

        "* `n_components`- The number of output dimensions (i.e. 2 for 2D, 3 for 3D)\n",
        "* `random_state` - Sets a random seed for reproducibility which ensures that running UMAP multiple times gives the same layout.\n",
        "* `metric` - The distance metric used to measure similarity between data points in the input space. Cosine works well for embeddings (text/image) since it cares about direction, not magnitude.\n",

        "* `spectral` Sets a Laplacian Eigenmap [@6789755] initialisation[^5]\n",
        "* `n_epochs` - The number of training iterations, with more epochs producing more more stable embedding, but taking a longer runtime.\n",
        "* `spread` - This works with `min_dist` to control how spread-out the clusters are.Larger spread makes clusters take more space in the embedding.\n",

However, for other types of property, such as houses of multiple occupancy or flats, there can be multiple UPRN within a TOID.

You might be thinking why we haven't just been using UPRN geography rather than TOID all along: they are after all [geographically referenced](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/search?q=PRD_ONSUD). The problem is that these tend to be less accurate locations for the building, so it is better to use TOID locations if wishing to attribute attributes at the building level.

        "In the following analysis we can identify those TOID that were categorised as having a building age older than 1930, which involved identifying those TOID which had a `CONSTRUCTION_AGE_BAND` falling into either '1900 or earlier', or '1900-1929'. The average embedding vector was calculated from all buildings constructed before 1930, creating a 64-dimensional \"profile\" representing the typical satellite characteristics of pre-1930 buildings. Cosine similarity[^8] was then used to compare each building's embedding vector against this average profile, producing a similarity score between 0 and 1 for every building in the dataset.\n",

        "The cluster analysis presented five distinct building types that align meaningfully with real-world urban morphology patterns. Cluster E emerged as the most distinctive group, representing larger specialised buildings such as industrial and commercial facilities. Cluster D captured high-density residential areas, predominantly terraced housing, while Clusters B and C represented different scales of residential development, with B trending toward detached and semi-detached properties. \n",
        "\n",
        "The analysis of building ages showed some clear associations with different construction periods. Cluster C was strongly associated with Victorian and Edwardian terraces (pre-1930), while Cluster E represented post-war development from the 1950s-70s.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Random Forest model's 49% accuracy in predicting building age from embeddings demonstrated moderate predictive power when distinguishing between the nine time periods. While this represents a meaningful improvement over random chance (11%), the results highlight important limitations. The model performs best on the most common construction periods (1900-1929, 1930-1949, and 1950-1966) but struggles with less common periods and shows systematic confusion between adjacent time periods. This pattern reflects both the gradual evolution of construction materials and techniques, and the challenges inherent in using 10-meter resolution imagery to capture subtle architectural differences."
