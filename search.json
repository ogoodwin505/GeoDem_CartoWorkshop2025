For example, a London specific OAC was developed as London has a drastically different demographic composition to the rest of the United Kingdom (Alex D.

This choice can significantly impact the quality and interpretability of the resulting geodemographic classification. Key considerations when choosing k:\n\nEach cluster be as homogeneous as possible.\nEach cluster should be as distinct from the others as possible.\nThe clusters should be as evenly sized as possible.\n\nClustergrams (Fleischmann 2023) are visualisation technique that shows how cluster assignments change as you increase the number of clusters (k). This helps you to understand the structure in very high-dimensional space in the following ways:\n\nFleischmann, Martin. 2023. “Clustergram: Visualization and Diagnostics for Cluster Analysis.” Journal of Open Source Software 8 (89): 5240. https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.05240.\n\nCluster separation: Helps you to determine the right number of clusters by visualising how cleanly clusters separate\n\nCluster stability: Shows which clusters persist across different k values (stable long lines) vs. those which are artifacts of over-clustering (short, erratic lines)\n\nSplit patterns: Reveals the natural hierarchy in the data by showing how clusters subdivide\n\nFurther guidance on interpreting clustergrams and choosing the number of clusters can be found here: Clustergram\n\n# Since k-means is sensitive to initialization, `n_init` determines the number of \n# times the algorithm runs with different centroid seeds. The final result is the \n# best outcome based on inertia/WCSS (within-cluster sum of squares).\nn_init = 100  # Use a low value for quick testing, increase (~100) for final results\ncgram = Clustergram(range(1, 10), n_init=n_init, random_state=random_seed,verbose=False)  # Initialize clustergram model\ncgram.fit(cleaned_variable_df)  # Fit model to data\ncgram.plot()  # Generate plot\nplt.savefig(\"outputs/plots/supergroup_clustergram.png\")  # Save figure\nplt.show()  # Display plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose the number of clusters (k) based on the clustergram above.\n\n# Define the number of clusters (K). Choose K based on the clustergram plot.\nnum_clusters = 5"

    "text": "LLM Cluster Naming (and description)\nTo create a useful geodemographic classification, we need to assign meaningful names and descriptions to each cluster. This helps in interpreting the clusters and communicating their characteristics effectively.\nTraditionally, this is done manually by examining the statistical profiles of each cluster (often with input (as we produced) sometimes with external ) and using domain knowledge to assign names. Either done by a single expert, panel or utilising crowd sourcing approaches. Either way it is a time consuming process. However, we can leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in this process. We have demonstrated that LLMs can be used to generate initial name and description suggestions based on the statistical profiles of each cluster (Alex D. Singleton and Spielman 2024).\nWe can use LLMs to generate initial name and description suggestions based on the statistical profiles of each cluster.\nAgain here we are using only the variables used in the clustering.

Language barriers are virtually absent, with\nresidents who cannot speak English well or at all appearing at roughly\none-third of the regional rate. The area exhibits strong ethnic\nhomogeneity, with households where all members share the same ethnic\ngroup appearing at moderately elevated levels. The demographic profile\nskews slightly older, with residents aged sixty-five to eighty-four\nand those aged eighty-five and over both appearing at moderately\nelevated rates. The housing landscape is characterised by owner-\noccupation at moderately elevated levels, with detached houses\nsubstantially overrepresented and semi-detached properties also\nappearing above regional averages. Conversely, terraced houses appear\nat less than half the regional rate, while flats are dramatically\nunderrepresented at roughly one-third of regional levels. Social\nrented accommodation is substantially below regional averages, as is\nprivate rental accommodation. The area demonstrates affluence through\nvehicle ownership, with households possessing two or more cars\nappearing at moderately elevated rates. The occupational structure\nreflects professional and managerial employment, with managers,\ndirectors, senior officials, professional occupations, and associate\nprofessional and technical occupations all appearing at moderately\nelevated levels. Elementary occupations are somewhat underrepresented.\nEducational attainment is strong, with Level 4 qualifications and\nabove appearing at moderately elevated rates. Employment rates are\nfavourable, with unemployment substantially below regional levels at\nroughly three-quarters of the regional rate. The neighbourhood shows a\nfamily-oriented character, with married couples moderately\noverrepresented and never-married individuals somewhat\nunderrepresented. Families with no children appear at moderately\nelevated levels. One-person households and communal establishment\nresidents are both substantially below regional averages, reinforcing\nthe family-oriented suburban character. \n\n\n\n\nWhile the LLM generated names and descriptions are a very useful starting point, it is important to review the outputs carefully both for accuracy, and that they make sense in the context of your specific region and purpose. Any use of LLMs in a production context would need to invove a human in the loop to review the outputs and a ground truthing exercise to ensure the outputs are valid."
